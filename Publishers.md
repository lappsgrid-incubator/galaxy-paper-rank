# Gold Standard Publishers

4398 DOI metadata files have a link to download the article for Text Data Mining (TDM) purposes. Of the small sample I checked all TDM files are Open Access and released under a CC, or similar, license.  Publisher Information

Many publishers make articles available in multiple mime types, but if articles are available in *application/pdf* that is the type listed. If a mime-type other that *application/pdf* is listed that means PDF versions of the articles are not available.
